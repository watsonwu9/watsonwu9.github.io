  <p class = 'intro'>How Does Family Income in Different States Change in the Past 30 Years?</p>
  <p class = 'intro'>Each year, millions of immigrants from the world settle in the USA and start to pursue their American dream. America is a vast country and those skillful immigrants perhap will make one of the most important choices in their life: pick up their new home state.To some extent, choosing which state to live in is like buy a big share of stock of that state. One who lives in that state live with the state. 
  </p>

  <p class = 'intro'>In order to compare the average life standard of  household between states, the median household annual income from 1985 to 2015 were retrieved from the US National Bureau of Cencus. 
  The national median household income is also presented, to control for the inlfation and the nationally natural growth.  
  </p>

  <p class = 'intro'>
  Interestingly,I found that the income of the residents in DC(sorry, this is not a state,literally) improves very fast. In 1985, family from the DC only earn 21,076 US dollar, or 89% of the national household income. However, in 2015, that number has arisen to 70071 US dollars, or 124% of the national household income. This means that 
  the family in DC has beaten the average!
